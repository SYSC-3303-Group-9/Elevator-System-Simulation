# Elevator-System-Simulation
This project is a design and implementation of an elevator control system and simulator. The system consist of an elevator controller (the Scheduler), a simulator for the elevator cars (which includes, the lights, buttons, doors and motors) and a simulator for the floors (which includes, buttons, lights and last, but not least, people who are too lazy to take the stairs). The elevator controller is multi-threaded since it will handle more than one car at a time. The simulation is configurable in terms of the number of floors, the number number of elevators, the time it takes to open and close the doors, and the time it takes to move between floors. The simulation will run on multiple computers as part of the project involves running the controller on its own machine with the simulator(s) running on a separate computer. The code is written in Java, using the Eclipse IDE.
